# Results and Discussion

The breadth and variety of this analysis can be a bit confusing at first but I 
believe I found a few insightful takeaways from this analysis.

1. Empirical Confirmation of Political Campaign Mythos############################################
    
    Democrats spend differently than Republicans
        democrats are less coordinated and spend less
        republicans are concerted, organized and give more

1. Suggestion of not too large a difference in type of contribution source or size by party########################

    Need further analysis
    
1. Scale of outside spending in 2020 Senate elections

    The hypothesis when I started this analysis was that there would be more out-of-state
    contributions (in number and amount) than in-state ones, but the size of that
    difference surprised me. I saw a supermajority of contributions and overall money
    coming from out of state, especially in big elections like South Carolina's and Georgia's.
    However, I think it is important to point out that once I broke it down by state and not
    just outside states vs. election state, I found that the election state sometimes had
    the most contributions out of any single state. For instance, Georgia was the source of
    the most money going into its elections. 

1. Utility of chord diagrams and heatmaps
    
    Seeing the themes in Democrat vs. Republican spending would not have been possible without
    visualization tools like the heatmap. What was vague or hard to discern in pure numbers,
    was almost automatically self-evident in a heatmap in which I could see the scale, intensity,
    and precision of contributions by each party. The same goes the chord diagrams, with which 
    any person gets to easily see the complicated web of money flowing from state to state, and
    can see which states play the biggest roles in each party's politics. It turns even the most 
    daunting, computer-killing data files into approachable, insightful visuals. I hope to 
    explore them further because I think they will have a huge impact on communicating policy
    and the realities of governance the average person.

1. Opaqueness of PACs and Campaign Financing

    I kept the analysis to just contributions to candidate committees as it is hard
    to analyze PAC and other entities's contributions. In FEC data there is no
    code easily linking them to a specific candidate. There is definitely a significant
    amount of money going into to them though and by not having them, the power
    of this project is limited. It seems to me to be another example of how 
    campaign funding remains very distance from and non-transparent to the average
    person. Thankfully there are sites and institutions that analyze this info, 
    but there still remain many barriers and the FEC is sometimes a part of that. 
    I definitetly garnered a new appreciation for election data analysts and what
    transparent campaign finance should mean.
